# Board Package Installation Steps
1. Download and Install Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
2. Double-click arduino.exe, and then go to **File->Preferences**
3. Paste following URL to 'Additional Boards Manager URLs' input field: 
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenNuvoton/NuMaker_UNO/master/package_nuvoton_index.json`
4. Under **Tools->Board->Boards Manger**, search `NuMaker UNO`, click **Install**
5. You can now select NuMaker UNO and install it in Arduino IDE.

# VCOM Driver Installation Steps (Optional for M032BT)
The Virtual COM (VCOM) interface requires a VCOM driver to be installed on PC first. 
The driver "Nu-Link_USB_Driver 1.x.exe" can be found at: http://www.nuvoton.com/opencms/resource-download.jsp?tp_GUID=SW0520150729202535

1. Execute "Nu-Link_USB_Driver 1.x.exe" after the USB cable is un-plugged.
2. Follow the steps of installation wizard to select setup language and installation location.
3. Plug in USB cable after driver installation complete.
4. Connect the NuMaker UNO with PC using a USB cable. If the driver is successfully installed, the Windows shall find a new device and then automatically find the correct driver. A virtual COM port named "Nuvoton Virtual Com Port" can be found in "Device Manager".
